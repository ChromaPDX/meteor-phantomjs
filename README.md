meteor-phantomjs
================

NPM wrapper for phantom js (works with modulus.io) Fork of https://github.com/gadicc/meteor-phantomjs/blob/master/package.js without sun package

* Specifically forked to run with Modulus.io http://www.modulus.io @gaicc's package didn't work as it was try to compile a sun package. This is a normal NPM phantomjs package which compiles successfully on modulus.io's infrastructure.
